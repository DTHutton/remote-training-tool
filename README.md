### About

Training timer is a simple tool to help visualize return times for facilitating a remote training class.


### Use

There are two options for using the tool.

#### Option One: Select one of the preset timers.

These preset timers are setup to make it easy for facilitators to determine a time for learners to return with one click. The timers come with 4 preset options.
* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 15 minutes
* Break (15 minutes)
* Lunch (30 minutes)

**Note**: At this time, these default options are all that is available. The ability to set these options will be added in a future release.

#### Option Two: Choose a specific return time.

Choose a specific return time. This is useful for when the preset timers have learners returning at awkward times like `10:58` and allow for them to have an extra couple of minutes of break while providing a clean time of return.

**Note**: At this time, only the return time will show when selected. A countdown timer for this option will be added in a future release.
